#My portfolio

This is my portfolio made my me. I used this to practice perfecting my craft, and learning to learn. In my journey of web development, my natural anxiousness for being successful has proved to be a double edged sword, I was afraid of failing and of not being smart enough, no matter what I did.

I am proud to be someone who has a portfolio at all, it is an honor to be able to say, "look, this is what I did with my own two hands and my brain." I intend to add more projects as I continue to work on my craft and make better and more cool projects.
